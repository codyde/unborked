# Sentry Setup Summary

This document summarizes the steps taken to integrate Sentry into the project based on the provided `sentry.md` instructions.

1.  **Install Sentry SDK:**
    *   The `@sentry/react` SDK was installed using the command `npm i @sentry/react@latest` as specified in `sentry.md`.

2.  **Sentry Project Creation:**
    *   Attempts were made to automatically create the Sentry project (`unborked` in organization `buildwithcode`, team `buildwithcode`) using the available Sentry tool.
    *   These attempts failed repeatedly due to authentication errors (`401 Unauthorized` or `404 Not Found` when trying different team slug formats).
    *   The user manually created the project in the Sentry UI and provided the DSN.

3.  **Sentry Initialization:**
    *   The Sentry initialization code, as specified in `sentry.md`, was added to the application's entry point, identified as `src/main.tsx`.
    *   The manually obtained DSN (`https://4cce768b3178c61875e8f1a8e039294b@o4508130833793024.ingest.us.sentry.io/4509088007585792`) was configured in the `Sentry.init` call.

4.  **Error Reporting Example (`Sentry.captureException`):**
    *   An example implementation was added to `src/pages/Home.tsx`. A button ("Trigger Test Error") was added that throws an error, catches it, and reports it using `Sentry.captureException`.
    *   A similar example implementation was added to `src/pages/Cart.tsx`, triggered by a "Trigger Cart Test Error" button.

5.  **Custom Tracing Example (`Sentry.startSpan`):**
    *   An example implementation was added to `src/pages/Home.tsx`. A button ("Trigger Traced Action") was added that wraps a simulated asynchronous operation using `Sentry.startSpan`, demonstrating how to add attributes.
        *   *Note:* There were difficulties resolving a TypeScript linter error related to setting the span status (`span.setStatus({ code: ... })`) within the error handler of this example. After several attempts to fix the import/usage of `SpanStatusCode`, the `span.setStatus` line was omitted from the example in `Home.tsx` to avoid the persistent error.
    *   A similar example implementation (also omitting `span.setStatus` in the error handler) was added to `src/pages/Cart.tsx`, triggered by a "Trigger Cart Traced Action" button.

The basic Sentry setup and examples from `sentry.md` are now integrated into the specified files.
